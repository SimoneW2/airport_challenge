#Airport Challenge
To understand this you will have to read the user story in the the README(fork).md file.

###My Process
Initially I wanted to check that that the class I created existed in my unit test.

Then I wanted to create  a test to see if my method responded to my class.

I wanted to test the functionality of my method in my class.

Unfortunately I did not get far as I would constantly change my mind on which class I should lead with the plane class or the airport class.
